    - Bug fix: was a fatal error when a value was submitted for Label element
      (code called delete_nested_hash_value instead of deleted_nested_hash_key).
    
    - Bug fix: RT#65728 Filter::Split shouldn't return a value if no value was
      submitted.
    
    - Bug fix: Element::Date now uses default() in preference to
      default_natural(). RT#65727

    - Now only delete submitted value if there's no other field on the form with
      the same name.

      being implicitly converted to a hash-ref or array-ref.

      field values are empty strings.
    
    - Fix: An empty block with nested_name set, containing Label elements and
      no other fields, was causing the block's nested_name to be added to
      $form->valid(). RT #54967

      ref-type than the element or processor which uses its values.
    
    - Update Element::reCAPTCHA tests after changes to Captcha::reCAPTHCA
      (bump dependency version).
