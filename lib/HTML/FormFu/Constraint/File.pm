sub constrain_value {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Ensure the submitted value is a file upload.

This Constraint is not needed if you use any of the C<File::*> Constraints,
as they all make the same check as this Constraint does.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

This can only verify that your CGI backend (CGI, Catalyst, CGI::Simple)
thinks it was a file upload. If the user submits a filename which doesn't
exist on their system, you will probably get a valid L<HTML::FormFu::Upload>
object, with a valid filehandle, but no Content-Length. This Constraint
would still see this as a valid uploaded file - if you want to ensure that
you get a file with content, instead use
L<HTML::FormFu::Constraint::File::Size> with
L<min|HTML::FormFu::Constraint::File::Size/min> set to C<1>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

Is a sub-class of, and inherits methods from L<HTML::FormFu::Constraint>
