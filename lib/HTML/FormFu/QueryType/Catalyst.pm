=head1 REMOVED METHODS

=head2 catalyst_upload

We no longer keep a reference to the

was causing issues under L<HTML::FormFu::MultiForm|HTML::FormFu::MultiForm>
after the L<Catalyst|Catalyst> 5.8 move to L<Moose|Moose>.

Because L</catalyst_upload> has been removed, we can no-longer call this
L<Catalyst::Request::Upload|Catalyst::Request::Upload> method.

=head2 link_to

Because L</catalyst_upload> has been removed, we can no-longer call this
L<Catalyst::Request::Upload|Catalyst::Request::Upload> method.
